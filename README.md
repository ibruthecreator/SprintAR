# SprintAR
NewHacks 2020

The idea was that you can create your own workspace, or join another person's workspace. Once you enter a workspace, you will have access to stickies and will be able to engage in real-time on things such as design sprints or product strategy brainstorm sessions. You can move stickies around, choose a color, and more. Later, you would be able to view all the work you did in the AR session on your laptop to analyze and review later.
